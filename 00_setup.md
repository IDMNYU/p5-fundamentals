# Setting up an environment for working with p5.js
_Last updated April 2 2021_
Before we can start start coding, we'll want to set up our development environment. There are a few different ways to do this, it all depends on your needs. 

Online editors are great for keeping stuff in the cloud, accessing anywhere, and quickly testing out ideas. It's got the lowest barrier to entry and requires nothing more than an internet connection. 
Local development is great when you expect to be offline, want control over your tools, or will be working with largewr media files, or simply want the affordances of your own setup.
Running your own derver is useful for deploying p5 sketches on a raspberry pi, or similar situation where you won't be viewing the content on the machine directly.
