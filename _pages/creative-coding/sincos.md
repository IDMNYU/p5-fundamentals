title: Sine & Cosine

In the previous [section](../cycles/) we saw how to define a cycle in terms of $$amplitude$$, $$period$$ and $$\mathit{offset}$$:

A little review:

$$Amplitude$$: how far the circle moves before going back to the beginning.

$$Period$$: how long it takes for one cycle to complete and start again (can be in seconds, but number of frames is more useful when using `frameCount`).

$$\mathit{Offset}$$: starting position of the circle.

Other than the modulus operator and the triangle wave, another easy way of generating cycles is by using the [sine and cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine) trigonometric functions. This might not be immediately clear from the wikipedia definition: *In the context of a right triangle: for a given angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of its hypotenuse; and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse*.

But, what's important to us here is to remember that both the sine and cosine functions repeat every 360ยบ or $$2\pi$$ radians.

In the case of sine, as the angle $$\theta$$ grows from $$0$$ to $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, $$sin(\theta)$$ grows from $$0$$ to $$1$$. As $$\theta$$ grows from $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$ to $$\pi$$, $$sin(\theta)$$ decreases from $$1$$ to $$0$$. As $$\theta$$ grows from $$\pi$$ to $$\frac{3\pi}{2}$$, $$sin(\theta)$$ goes from $$0$$ to $$-1$$, and finally as $$\theta$$ grows from $$\frac{3\pi}{2}$$ to $$2\pi$$, $$sin(\theta)$$ increases from $$-1$$ to $$0$$. After that, as $$\theta$$ keeps growing, to $$3\pi$$, $$4\pi$$, $$5\pi$$, etc, the values of $$sin(\theta)$$ will keep repeating and always be between $$[-1 , 1]$$. In other words: \$$sin(\theta + 2\pi) = sin(\theta)$$

If we look for equations that relate the sine and cosine functions to cyclic or [harmonic](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Classical_Mechanics/Classical_Mechanics_(Dourmashkin)/23%3A_Simple_Harmonic_Motion/23.01%3A_Introduction_to_Periodic_Motion#Simple_Harmonic_Motion:_Quantitative) motion, we might find something like this:

$$y(t) = A \times sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P}\times t\right)$$

where $$A$$ is the amplitude and $$P$$ is the period.

In p5js this could be rewritten as:
```js
let x = A * sin(2 * PI / periodFrames * frameCount);
```

where $$A$$ is the amplitude, $$P$$ is the period in number of frames and `frameCount` is the variable that keeps growing indefinitely:

Hmmm.... this kind of works. Since the range of `sin()` is $$[-1, 1]$$, our circle is oscillating between $$[-amplitude, amplitude]$$, which isn't really what we want. One easy way to fix this is to add 1 to the `sin()` function so we have a range that goes between $$[0, 2]$$, then divide that by $$2$$ to bring the range down to $$[0, 1]$$ and, finally, multiply by the amplitude:

$$x = \frac{A}{2}\times \left(sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P}\times frameCount\right) + 1\right)$$

Much better. And this same equation works for other parameters, like the circle radius. We just have to define an $$amplitude$$, $$period$$ and $$\mathit{offset}$$ that makes sense for radius values:

We can take some time to play with the parameters here and build some intuition about how they affect the motion of the circle. Try changing `xPeriodSec`, `rPeriodSec`, `rAmplitude` and `rOffset`.

If we want, we can easily change the variable names and equations to make the circle oscillate vertically:

{% include p5-editor.html id="EDewPuJ1t" %}

Here $$amplitude$$ is the whole screen `height` and there's no $$\mathit{offset}$$, so it starts at $$0$$.

Now, we can combine *harmonic motion* in the `x` and `y` direction to get *elliptic cycles*:

{% include p5-editor.html id="u4OjI0_At" %}

We just have to make sure we use $$sin()$$ for one direction and $$cos()$$ for the other, or else we'll just get motion in a straight diagonal line.

If we make the `x` and `y` functions have different periods, we will get a nice [Lissajous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) movement:

Putting it all together, and using $$sin()$$ and $$cos()$$ for the `x`, `y` and `radius` parameters ends up giving our sketch a 3D effect:
