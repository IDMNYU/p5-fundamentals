title: Sound Synthesis

## NOTE:
To use the sound library, we have to include the [p5.sound library](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) in our project's `index.html` file after the p5.js file, like this:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.7.0/lib/p5.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.7.0/lib/addons/p5.sound.js"></script>
```

## !!! Sounds !!!
