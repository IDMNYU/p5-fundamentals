# The Internet

# The Browser

# Javascript

While you can write software anywhere, a scrap of paper, text pad, back of your hand, itâ€™s best to write it in an application that will understand what to do with the code provided. With javascript, the code runs in a web browser. It's an example of an interpreted language. The code itself resides in a webpage (made of HTML and CSS) and the browser interprets what to do. This means that the end result isn't an executable, or standalone application. It lives inside another document.
