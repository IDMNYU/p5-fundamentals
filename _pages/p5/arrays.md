## Review

Before we start looking at *arrays*, the main topic of this page, let's review a couple of concepts that will make it easier for us to visualize what they are and how to use them.

We saw the p5.js variables [`mouseX`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX) and [`mouseY`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY) when we looked at [variables](../variables/), [conditionals](../conditionals/) and [functions](../functions/).

These variables always hold the `x` and `y` position of our mouse during the execution of our sketch, so if we use them inside our `draw()` function to draw an ellipse, it will look like the ellipse is following our mouse.

{% include p5-editor.html id="iQgAQwWr-" %}

Great.

When we looked at [conditionals](../conditionals/) and [functions](../functions/) we also saw code that could detect overlap between our mouse and different shapes.

Like this code that changes the color of rectangles when the mouse hovers over them:

{% include p5-editor.html id="GZZ2GtQU4" %}

Or this code that changes the shapes that it draws when it detects collision between our mouse ellipse and an *obstacle*:

{% include p5-editor.html id="FXP8atSEcM" %}

Also great.

But, right now, we are not so interested in the logic for detecting collision or overlap. Instead, we want to look at how we can rewrite the code that defines the *obstacles* in those sketches in a way that will make it easier to add new obstacles and change the ones that are already there.

## Lists

Let's take a look at a simplified version of one of those sketches, that only draws ellipses. Here we want $$5$$ obstacle ellipses, and since later we'll want to use their positions to detect collision, we'll use $$5$$ variables to hold their `x` positions and another $$5$$ variables for their `y` positions.

{% include p5-editor.html id="9wTdOp6YM" %}

This is all fine and works well... for $$5$$ ellipses. What if this is the initial prototype of a game we are making and eventually we will want to have $$100$$ obstacles ?

Writing `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, ..., `x99` to define all of the values just isn't very practical. An then, calling `rect(x0, y0, d)`, `rect(x1, y1, d)`, `rect(x2, y2, d)`, ..., `rect(x99, y99, d)` inside `draw()` is just as much work.

Luckily, JavaScript, like most programming languages, has a builtin data-structure called [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) that can help us organize data like this.

Just like we can declare variables to hold numbers:
```js
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = 90;
```

We can declare variables to hold arrays:
```js
let a = [];
let b = [];
```

But, unlike a regular variable that holds just one value, arrays hold sequences of values.

The syntax with the `[` and `]` square brackets above is kind of funny looking, but it's telling the computer that we want the variables `a` and `b` to be arrays, and we want these arrays to start empty.

If instead we wanted to declare arrays already with values inside, this is the syntax:
```js
let ints = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
let evens = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8];
let odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
```

The `ints` variable holds an array, and that array has $$5$$ elements, the first $$5$$ non-negative integers: $$0$$, $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$ and $$4$$.

The `evens` and `odds` arrays also hold $$5$$ elements each, the first $$5$$ non-negative even and odd whole numbers, respectively.

Once we have declared and initialized an array, we can access its members using square brackets `[` and `]`:

```js
evens[0]; // first value of the evens array: 0
evens[1]; // second value of the evens array: 2
evens[2]; // third value of the evens array: 4
// ... etc
```

Let's see how we can use this in our sketch with the obstacles.

Instead of `x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1`, etc, we'll declare arrays to hold the `x` and `y` positions of our obstacles, and use the bracket notation to access individual elements when it's time to draw them.

## Iterators

At first this doesnâ€™t seem like an advantage at all, because we just changed `x0`, `x1`, etc for `x[0]`, `x[1]`, etc, which actually requires even more typing.

The full advantage of using arrays comes from the fact that we can iterate through them using `for()` loops and avoid writing repetitive code like the one above.

For example, if we want to print all the values in an array called `x`, we can use code like this:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i += 1) {
  print(x[i]);
}
```

This is new and can look intimidating at first, so let's go over it in detail.

First, we create a `for()` loop that counts from $$0$$ all the way to `x.length` in increments of $$1$$. This is just like any `for()` loop we've seen [here](../patterns/) or [here](../counters/). The one difference is that the loop's end condition (the `i < x.length` expression) doesn't use a fixed value, nor one of the variables that have to do with the canvas dimensions, like `width` and `height`.

Instead, our loop is using a variable that belongs to our array `x` and tells us how many elements are in the array. So, if our array has $$5$$ elements in it, the loop will execute $$5$$ times. If our array has $$50$$ elements in it, it will execute $$50$$ times. An advantage of using the `x.length` variable instead of a fixed value for the end-condition expression, like `i < 5`, is that this way we can add or remove elements to our array without having to change this code.

In the specific example above, the only thing the loop body does is `print(x[i])`, which prints the value of the element in position `i` of the array. Since `i` is our loop variable that counts from $$0$$ to $$5$$, the result of the loop is the same as:

```js
print(x[0]);
print(x[1]);
print(x[2]);
print(x[3]);
print(x[4]);
```

Except we didn't have to write all of those lines and risk a spelling mistake.

Let's use this in our sketch with the obstacles to see how we can avoid writing repetitive code.

After we've declared our arrays with `x` and `y` positions, we'll iterate through them in order to draw the ellipses.

{% include p5-editor.html id="8vZX0M-vR" %}

Same result. Way less code.

And, more importantly, more elegant and maintainable code.

## Extending

Now that we are drawing our elements by iterating over our array using a `for()` loop, we can easily add more obstacles to our sketch.

All we have to do is add elements to the `x` and `y` arrays, but the rest of the code in `draw()` stays exactly the same.

{% include p5-editor.html id="3wCddvEDi" %}

And, if we get bored of writing the `x` and `y` coordinates by hand, we can use what we learned about [`random()`](../random/) to create some random positions for our obstacles inside `setup()`.

We can start with empty `x` and `y` arrays:
```js
let x = [];
let y = [];
```

Then, we can use a `for()` loop to count to $$5$$, and `random()` to get $$5$$ random coordinate pairs. Once we have coordinates, we can add them to the end of the arrays using the special array function [`push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push).

For example, this is how we add the numbers $$10$$, $$12$$ and $$14$$ to the end of an array called `evens`:
```js
evens.push(10);
evens.push(12);
evens.push(14);
```

And this is how we add a random coordinate between $$0$$ and `width` to the end of our `x` array:
```js
let mx = random(0, width);
x.push(mx);
```

We can use something like this for the `x` and `y` coordinates in our sketch.

We'll see how to make sure the obstacles don't overlap when we talk about [classes](../classes/)., but for now, arrays, FTW!
