## Multi-Dimensional Noise

Towards the end of the [noise](../../creative-coding/more-random/) exercises, we saw how to call the `noise()` function with multiple parameters to get a sequence of values that varies consistently in multiple dimensions.

This means that when we call `noise(x, y)`, as long as the sequences that we use for `x` and `y` both vary gradually, the resulting sequence will also vary gradually and each value will still be somewhat *related* to the previous one.

Let's visualize this.

Let's first iterate through our canvas and pick a random grayscale value to draw at every pixel:

{% include p5-editor.html id="wJcpEDZ5Q" %}

Pretty random. Each pixel value is completely independent of its location and of previous values.

Let's use `noise(x)` now, and remember that we might want to divide the value of `x` by $$10$$ or $$100$$ in order to only gradually change the value returned by `noise()` slightly as we move from location `x` to `x + 1`:

{% include p5-editor.html id="_d2qwwEpQ" %}

We get stripes, since every row of pixels calls `noise(x)` with the exact same values for `x`. We saw this before when we looked at a grid of ellipses.

Let's use `noise(x, y)`, so we can vary our parameters to `noise()` by row and column:

{% include p5-editor.html id="8456VlDl7" %}

Now, every pixel's color is slightly related to the colors around it, which makes the canvas look like smoke or clouds.

## Noisy Colors

Let's experiment with colors, and use `noise(x, y)` to pick how much we vary between two complementary colors.

We'll use the `noise()` function to pick a value between $$0$$ and $$255$$ for the red channel of our color, we'll keep the green channel always a constant, and the blue channel will always be the inverse of the red channel:

{% include p5-editor.html id="ma0T_JrCb" %}

This is cool, but it still looks like clouds. Let's add some thresholding to try to bring out more of the yellows. We'll do this by using an `if()` statement and forcing the color to full yellow even when it's just barely above the halfway point between yellow and blue:

{% include p5-editor.html id="edKgZh_Ou" %}

This looks pretty cool, let's do something similar to the blue. Let's force it to full blue even if the amount of yellow is just below the halfway point:

{% include p5-editor.html id="YF7ghy4EL" %}

This is starting to look like a map! And every time we run the sketch we get a different pattern!

## 2D Terrains

We can already see how something like this can be used to create $$2D$$ maps or terrains in video games.

Let's reorganize our code a little bit, and adjust our thresholds and colors.

We'll use a variable called `nLevel`, to store each pixel's noise level as a value between $$0$$ and $$1$$. We'll then use this value to threshold our noisy canvas and pick from one of $4$$ or $$5$$ colors that will make up our map.

{% include p5-editor.html id="5rDownf7D" %}

We can change the parameters to the `noise()` function to adjust how our map looks. What's the effect of calling `noise(x / 50, y / 50)` or `noise(x / 200, y / 200)` instead of `noise(x / 100, y / 100)`?

{% include p5-editor.html id="5HaXb2qmF" %}

Change the `noiseFactor` variable above and see what effect it has on our map ‚òùÔ∏è.

## 3D Terrains

`#spoilerAlert`: the third dimension is time.

So, just like we added another parameter to the `noise()` function to make sure pixels that are close to each other end up with similar colors, we can also add a third parameter to allow us to change our map gradually from frame to frame. We'll call `noise(x, y, t)`, where `t` is a sequence of values related to the `frameCount` of our running sketch:

{% include p5-editor.html id="mem8MaQDo" %}

This works, but trying to update all pixels every frame is a bit too much work for the browser, even with a small canvas.

We can take advantage of the fact that we can scale the `frameCount` by `noiseFactor` to control how similar/different consecutive frames are, and instead of updating every pixel every frame, we can just iterate over every other pixel.

We'll use a variable called `pixelGroup` that will alternate between $$0$$ and $$1$$ each frames and will let us know which rows of pixels to update at a given frame, the even rows or the odd ones:

{% include p5-editor.html id="Zhcfz732T" %}

This already makes our sketch twice as fast, since we're only updating half of the pixels every frame.

Can we do better ? What if we implement the same trick for the columns as well as the rows?

{% include p5-editor.html id="lLyTeABZy" %}

# ü§î

Kind of works, but it looks like we're only ever updating half of the pixels. The other half stays pink.

What's happening is that we're only ever updating pixels that are in even rows AND even columns, or odd rows AND odd columns, but pixels in even rows and odd columns or odd rows and even columns don't ever get updated.

<div class="scaled-images left w75">
  <img src = "{{ '/assets/images/projects/pixel-groups-2.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
</div>

What we have to do is split the pixels into $$4$$ groups, and iterate through every pixel in each of these groups every other $$4^{th}$$ frame.

<div class="scaled-images left w75">
  <img src = "{{ '/assets/images/projects/pixel-groups-4.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
</div>

The math for calculating the start pixel at every row and column is a bit strange at first:
```js
let pixelGroup = frameCount % 4;
let xStart = pixelGroup / 2;
let yStart = pixelGroup % 2;
```

But if we look at the values for `xStart` and `yStart` we'll see that this is one way to get all possible combinations of even/odd row and column numbers:

pixelGroup | xStart | yStart
:--- | :--- | :---
$$0$$ | `even` | `even`
$$1$$ | `even` | `odd`
$$2$$ | `odd` | `even`
$$3$$ | `odd` | `odd`

{% include p5-editor.html id="kfqY5zrDB" %}

This is still a bit slow, but it's already four times faster than the original, and could be a meditation upon geological changes.

## 4D Terrains

`#spoilerAlert`: the fourth dimension is time.

`#spoilerAlert2`: we probably won't need to call `noise()` using $$4$$ parameters.

Before we start, let's get our canvas ready for $$3D$$ drawings.

Instead of the pixel group trick above, let's draw squares of width `gridWidth` with our colors. This makes our terrain look a little too pixelated, or [*8-bit*](https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=8%20bit%20video%20game), in our current monitors, but we'll change it soon:

{% include p5-editor.html id="7kOAIddTS" %}

Now, let's add the $$3^{rd}$$ dimension. We'll have to change our canvas type to `WEBGL`:
```js
createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL);
```

And translate the canvas back to the top-left of the screen since in `WEBGL` mode the $$(0, 0)$$ origin is in the center of the canvas:
```js
translate(-width / 2, -height / 2);
```

And, just to make sure we actually have a $$3^{rd}$$ dimension, let's rotate the canvas around its $$x-axis$$ with:
```js
rotateX(PI / 3);
```

{% include p5-editor.html id="5t8vN5l-D" %}


In order to add height/depth to our map, we have to change how we draw the squares on screen.

Since we're going to want to control all $$3$$ dimensions of every vertex in our rectangles, instead of drawing flat rectangles we should consider drawing shapes using the p5.js [`beginShape()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape) function. We could use `QUADS`, but `QUAD_STRIP` and `TRIANGLE_STRIP` will make it even easier for us to specify the vertices of all rectangles in any given row.

To put this into code, we just have to realize that when drawing row `y`, we actually also need vertices that would be at row `y + gridWidth`, so we're always drawing pairs of vertices.

Order of visited locations for drawing rectangles:
<div class="scaled-images left w75">
  <img src = "{{ '/assets/images/projects/quad-strip-00.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
</div>

Order of visited vertices for drawing `QUAD_STRIPS`:
<div class="scaled-images left w75">
  <img src = "{{ '/assets/images/projects/quad-strip-01.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
</div>

The code:
```js
vertex(x, y, 0);
vertex(x, y + gridWidth, 0);
```

Drawing rectangles like this speeds up our sketch because instead of sending color and shape information to our screens for every rectangle in our grid, the CPU prepares a whole strip/row of colors and shapes, that only get sent to the monitor once per row.

We can even increase our `gridWidth` a little:

{% include p5-editor.html id="jCxs2TzQg" %}

We just have to add heights to our vertices.

Since we already have a noise number that we're using to calculates the colors of our map, we can use the same number to pull our vertices up or down in the `z` direction:

```js
let z = map(nLevel, 0, 1, -128, 128);
```

And we need to add another call to `noise()`, using the values for the position of the second vertex in order to get its `z` value.

In pseudo-code:

```js
let nLevel0 = noise(x, y, t);
let nLevel1 = noise(x, y + gridWidth, t);

let z0 = map(nLevel0, 0, 1, -128, 128);
let z1 = map(nLevel1, 0, 1, -128, 128);

vertex(x, y, z0);
vertex(x, y + gridWidth, z1);
```

In real code, with some adjustments to the position of the canvas:

{% include p5-editor.html id="C3iEmws2q" %}

This is good. Interesting. It looks like the rise and fall of mountains, but the colors and the blending between colors doesn't look too good.

This is because the `QUAD_STRIP` tries to blend colors between its vertices, but since each row is a separate strip, it only blends in the `x` direction. 

We can, of course, just remove all of the colors:

{% include p5-editor.html id="nQnhxKPb4" %}

But, this is boring. Let's fix our colors and in the process learn some tricks for speeding up generative graphics.

Let's begin by combining all of the `QUAD_STRIP` shapes into one shape, by calling `beginShape()` only once, outside all of our loops:

{% include p5-editor.html id="_T8t0jhW9" %}

It looks like in addition to NOT fixing the blending, this also broke something else.

When our `QUAD_STRIP` gets to the end of a row, it gets connected to the vertices at the very beginning of the next row. This is what's causing the long weird diagonal shapes in our canvas. We can fix this by adding some extra vertices under the canvas to hide these connecting `QUADS`.
```js
for (let y = 0; y < height; y += gridWidth) {
  vertex(0, y, -200);
  vertex(0, y + gridWidth, -200);
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += gridWidth) {
    // ... draw vertices
  }
  vertex(width, y, -200);
  vertex(width, y + gridWidth, -200);
}
```

Independent of this, the reason why the colors aren't blending between rows is because the two vertices we add every iteration are getting the same color value based on the `noiseLevel` of the first vertex. So there's no blending to be done. We should instead give each vertex its own color.

Let's refactor the color logic into a function and call that twice, once for each of the two `noiseLevel` values:

{% include p5-editor.html id="HPFsncYbq" %}

This is better !

But, what if we added our own blending between colors at each level?

Since we already separated the color logic into its own function, this shouldn't be too bad.

For each of the color levels, we'll use [`lerpColor()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerpColor) to pick a color value between the previous and current colors. Before calling `lerpColor()` we just have to `map()` the `noiseLevel` from our specific color level range to a value between $$0$$ and $$1$$:
```js
// at color level 1
let t = map(n, minN, maxN, 0, 1);
fColor = lerpColor(COLOR[0], COLOR[1], t);
```

This can get a bit slow, due to all of the color blending, but since we now have blending between vertices and blending between height levels, we can decrease the resolution of our grid to try to increase our frame rate:

{% include p5-editor.html id="rULkjLIeK" %}

This looks good!

And now that the colors are fixed we can clearly see that our ocean is not working like an ocean at all. There are no valleys in the middle of the ocean!

Let's fix that by adding some clamping to our height map. There should be no negative heights, and the positive heights should only start with the third color, so, when `noiseLevel` is greater than $$0.5$$:
```js
let z0 = map(nLevel0, 0.5, 1, 0, 128, true);
```
